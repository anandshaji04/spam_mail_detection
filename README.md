# Spam Mail Detection using Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project aims to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) using logistic regression. The logistic regression model is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails, with features extracted from the text of the emails. The goal is to develop a classifier that can accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of a collection of labeled emails, where each email is represented by a set of features derived from its text content. These features may include word frequencies, presence of certain keywords, etc. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set for model evaluation.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Spam_Mail_Detection.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance.
3. You can modify the notebook according to your requirements or experiment with different preprocessing techniques or model parameters for better classification accuracy.

## Results

Provide details of the model's performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the test set.
